## mooc.fi
mooc.fi stands for Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by the University of Helsinki in Finland. It is a series of courses primarily focused on teaching computer science and programming skills. I started the python programming on March 8, 2024 and this repository is the exercise log.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find:

- Python code files organized by topic or project.
- Updates on my learning progress through commit history.
- Possibly some notes or reflections on concepts learned.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Document my Python learning journey, particularly through the MOOC.fi course, for personal reflection.
- Serve as a digital diary to look back on my progress and growth as a Python programmer.
- Provide a space to store and organize code snippets and projects as I learn.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and commit history to see my learning progress. However, please note that this repository is primarily for personal use, and there may not be any specific guidelines for contributors or usage beyond my personal documentation needs.
